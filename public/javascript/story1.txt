		Art is art doesent matter where it is?..

Way back, there was a poor man named ram leaving in the village.He was a very good illustrator.Daily he will go to feed animals in the forest and draw something on tree's As he neither had any drawing kit nor money to buy it.All people will make fun of him saying that he is mentally disturbed that's why he is drawing on trees.One day king of that state came for inspection and saw paintings on trees.He liked those paintings and investigated about it.He got to know about ram.He hired ram as shahi illustrator.Finally,ram got what his art deserves.
